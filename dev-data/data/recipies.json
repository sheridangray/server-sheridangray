[{"id":1,"name":"Pan-Seared Cod with Parmesan-Crusted Squash & Roasted Red Potatoes","description":"Parmesan, like many aged cheeses, is hard because of its low water content. During the aging process, nearly all of its moisture evaporates. What that means for you, Blue Apron Chefs, is that it won't melt when heated. Instead it will toast and brown, creating a flavorful, crispy crust. That's exactly how you'll use it in the dish; sprinkled over juicy, yellow squash and roasted in the oven to perfection.","numberOfServings":2,"caloriesPerServing":500,"prepTimeInMinutes":20,"cookTimeInMinutes":15,"ingredients":[{"name":"Oregano","quantity":1,"quantityType":"Bunch"},{"name":"Lemon","quantity":1,"quantityType":"Whole"},{"name":"Yellow Squash","quantity":1,"quantityType":"pound"},{"name":"Baby Re Potatoes","quantity":0.5,"quantityType":"pound"},{"name":"Grated Parmesan Cheese","quantity":0.33,"quantityType":"cup"},{"name":"Cod Fish","quantity":2,"quantityType":"whole"},{"name":"Rice Flour","quantity":0.5,"quantityType":"cup"}],"instructions":[{"section":"Prepare the ingredients","instruction":"Preheat the oven to 400°F.
